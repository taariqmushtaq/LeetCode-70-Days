This was a problem, in which we have two strings:

(case 1)
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "pqr"

(case 2)
word1 = "sqts"
word2 = "ab"

Then we have to add them like :   ( " a p b q c r ") 1st case
                                  ( " s a q b t s ") 2nd case

size of both strings can vary, so we have to merge them, by appending. Good Luck.
