<p1>In this problem, we have an array of numbers and a target number like 

case 01;
[2,3,4,6] with target 6 

case 02:
[3,2], with target 5 

case 03:
[1,2,7,5] with target 9

So, we have to add the numbers to get the target, like in case 03, it will be the returned indexes array will be [1,2] because 2,7 are at 1 and 2 indexes.
Output:

case 01: return array [0,2] with target 6 because 2 and 4 are at 0,2 indexes.
case 02: return array [0,1] with target 5 because 3 and 2 are at 0,1 indexes.
case 03: return array [1,2] with target 9 because 2 and 7 are at 1,2 indexes. </p1>
